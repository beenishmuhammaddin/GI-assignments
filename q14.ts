//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

// List of people to invite to dinner
let guestList: string[] = ["Bali Sakina", "Mudabbir Ahmed", "Zarnish"];

// Invite each person to dinner
console.log("Assalam-o-alaikum " + guestList[0] + ", Join me for dinner? Your ideas are mind-blowing, and I'd love to chat over some food. Cheers, [BINISH]");

console.log("Assalam-o-alaikum " + guestList[1] + ", How about dinner together? Your words are inspiring, and I'd love to hear more in person. Take care, [BINISH]");

console.log(" Assalam-o-alaikum" + guestList[2] + ", Up for dinner? Your work has changed the world, and I'd love to pick your brain over a meal. Best, [BINISH]");
