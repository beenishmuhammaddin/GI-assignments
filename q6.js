//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
// We have a person's name with extra spaces.
////let personName = "\t\n   Binish Rajput \n\t";
// Display the name with the extra spaces.
//console.log("Original Name:");
//console.log(personName);
// Now, let's remove the extra spaces.
//let strippedName = personName.trim();
// Display the name after removing the extra spaces.
//console.log("\nStripped Name:");
//console.log(strippedName);
